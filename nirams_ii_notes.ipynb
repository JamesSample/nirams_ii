    "## 1. Model background and development\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Original NIRAMS model\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Nitrogen Risk Assessment Model for Scotland (NIRAMS) was developed at the Macaulay Institute (now the James Hutton Institute) during 2002/3. Development work was led by Dr. Sarah Dunn and a description of the model is provided by Dunn *et al.* ([2004a](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/8/191/2004/hess-8-191-2004.html) and [2004b](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/8/205/2004/hess-8-205-2004.html)). One of the main motivations was to create a simple, Scotland-specific nitrate leaching model, similar to the MAGPIE model for England and Wales developed by [Lord and Anthony (2006)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2000.tb00222.x/abstract). The model was designed with the EU Nitrates Directive (ND) in mind and key requirements included being able to apply it at national scale and in areas with sparse observational data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Physical process representations were kept very simple in order to reduce the number of parameters as far as possible. NIRAMS is therefore highly conceptualised, with most of its computational complexity coming from the fact it is fully spatially distributed (i.e. grid based) rather than because any of the individual calculations are complex. This makes the model unusual, because historically most developers of water quality models have refined and increased the process complexity first, before expanding the spatial domain. For example, most fully distributed water quality models (e.g. [MIKE SHE](https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/products/mike-she)) are extremely complex and highly parameterised, and even semi-distributed models like [INCA](http://www.reading.ac.uk/geographyandenvironmentalscience/research/INCA/) and [HYPE](http://hype.sourceforge.net/) have much more complicated process representation than NIRAMS. \n",
    "\n",
    "NIRAMS could therefore be criticised for being both slow (because it’s spatially distributed) and overly simplistic. On the other hand, the grid-based outputs are extremely flexible, because results from a single model run can be analysed in different ways for different spatial units. Furthermore, outside of a handful of academic study catchments, we generally lack the observational data necessary to robustly calibrate and evaluate highly parameterised models, so the simplicity of NIRAMS may be an advantage for many practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. NIRAMS II\n",
    "\n",
    "The original model was coded in [Avenue](ftp://www.kcgov.us/KCCSData/KCGIS/Into2AV/Intro2Avenue/avenue.htm) for ArcView 3.x. Although Avenue is still a useful language for grid computations, it was officially discontinued in 2002 and subsequent releases of ArcGIS have favoured first Visual Basic and, most recently, [Python](https://www.python.org/). Starting in 2011, the NIRAMS Avenue code was ported to Python 2.7 and, at the same time, the model’s handling of agricultural data was redesigned by switching from parish-level census summaries to more detailed field- and farm-scale information based on the [Scottish Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/farmingrural/Agriculture/grants/Schemes/18148/11836). This adds significantly to the complexity of pre-processing the model's input data, but has the advantage of providing more spatial detail and allowing e.g. identification of potential diffuse pollution “hotspots”. A number of other changes were also made, including refining the nitrate leaching representation by incorporating processes from the STREAM-N model ([Dunn *et al.*, 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941300735X)) and enhancing the model's performance and temporal resolution. Nevertheless, the basic structure and conceptualisation of NIRAMS II remains largely unchanged compared to the original.\n",

    "### 4.1. NIRAMS II modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is divided into six Python files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[nirams_ii_main.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/nirams_ii_main.py)** is the main entry point for those wishing to perform a single run of the model (i.e. produce output based on a single parameter set). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[nirams_ii_param_combos.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/nirams_ii_param_combos.py)** allows users to specify lists of possible values for the model's physical parameters. The model is then run once for each unique parameter combination in the supplied lists. This makes it possible to explore different model parameterisations and to undertake basic sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. The code uses Python's `multiprocessing` module to distribute model runs across multiple processes, thereby improving performance. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[input_output.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/input_output.py)**. All the input datasets required to run NIRAMS II are stored in an [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) data store. Model outputs are also written to this format as well as (optionally) to a series of GeoTiffs. `input_output.py` streamlines the process of reading and writing to these various data formats. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[snow.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/snow.py)** provides functions for calculating volumes of snowfall and snow melt based on a simple degree-day melting model, as described above. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[drainage.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/drainage.py)** keeps track of the water entering and leaving the soil and groundwater reservoirs, and partitions drainage among three flow pathways (overland flow, shallow sub-surface flow and groundwater flow). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[nitrate.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/nitrate.py)** includes functions for estimating the amount of nitrate added to each grid cell at each time step, and also calculates the amount of nitrate leached by the draining waters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Running the model\n",
    "\n",
    "To run NIRAMS II, the user must first obtain the **input HDF5 file**, which contains gridded datasets representing meterological time series, soil properites and agricultural activities. Unfortunately this file cannot be made freely available, as several of the datasets included in it were obtained under license and cannot be redistributed. If you are interested in using the model for academic research of relevance to the Scottish Government, it may be possible to make this file available - please contact the [James Hutton Institute](http://www.hutton.ac.uk/contact-us) in Aberdeen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to **install Python 2.7**. If you're on Windows, I highly recommend [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/), which is a portable Python distribution which will not interfere with anything else on your system. You will also need to install [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), either by entering `pip install gdal` at the *WinPython* command prompt (not the standard Windows command prompt), or by downloading the appropriate [Python \"wheel\"](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal) and using the WinPython control panel.\n",
