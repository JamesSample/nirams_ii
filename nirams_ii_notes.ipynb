    "## 1. Model background and development\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. The original NIRAMS model\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Nitrogen Risk Assessment Model for Scotland (NIRAMS) was developed at the Macaulay Institute (now the James Hutton Institute) during 2002/3. Development work was led by Dr. Sarah Dunn and a description of the model is provided by Dunn *et al.* ([2004a](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/8/191/2004/hess-8-191-2004.html) and [2004b](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/8/205/2004/hess-8-205-2004.html)). One of the main motivations was to create a simple, Scotland-specific nitrate leaching model, similar to the MAGPIE model for England and Wales developed by [Lord and Anthony (2006)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2000.tb00222.x/abstract). The model was designed with the EU Nitrates Directive (ND) in mind and key requirements included being able to apply it at national scale and in areas with sparse observational data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Physical process representations were kept very simple in order to reduce the number of parameters as far as possible. NIRAMS is therefore highly conceptualised, with most of its computational complexity coming from the fact it is fully spatially distributed (i.e. grid based) rather than because any of the individual calculations are complex. This makes the model unusual, because historically most developers of water quality models have refined and increased the process complexity first, before expanding the spatial domain. For example, most fully distributed water quality models (e.g. [MIKE SHE](https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/products/mike-she)) are extremely complex and highly parameterised, and even semi-distributed models like [INCA](http://www.reading.ac.uk/geographyandenvironmentalscience/research/INCA/) and [HYPE](http://hype.sourceforge.net/) have much more complicated process representation than NIRAMS. \n",
    "\n",
    "NIRAMS could therefore be criticised for being both too slow (because it’s spatially distributed) and too simplistic. On the other hand, the gird-based outputs are extremely flexible, because results from a single model run can be analysed in multiple different ways and for different spatial units. Additionally, outside of a handful of academic study catchments, we generally lack the observational data necessary to robustly calibrate and evaluate highly parameterised models. The simplicity of NIRAMS may therefore be an advantage for policy/regulatory applications.\n",

    "### 1.2. NIRAMS II\n",
    "\n",
    "The original model was coded in [Avenue](ftp://www.kcgov.us/KCCSData/KCGIS/Into2AV/Intro2Avenue/avenue.htm) for ArcView 3.x. Although Avenue is still a useful language for grid computations, it was officially discontinued in 2002 and subsequent releases of ArcGIS have favoured first Visual Basic and, most recently, [Python](https://www.python.org/). Starting in 2011, the NIRAMS Avenue code was ported to Python 2.7 and, at the same time, the model’s handling of agricultural data was redesigned by switching from parish-level census summaries to more detailed field- and farm-scale resolution information based on the [Scottish Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/farmingrural/Agriculture/grants/Schemes/18148/11836). This adds significantly to the complexity of pre-processing the model's input data, but has the advantage of providing more spatial detail and allowing e.g. identification of potential diffuse pollution “hotspots”. A number of other changes were also made, such as refining the nitrate leaching representation by incorporating processes from the STREAM-N model ([Dunn *et al.*, 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941300735X)) and enhancing the performance and temporal resolution. Nevertheless, the basic structure and conceptualisation of NIRAMS II remain largely unchanged compared to the original model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The code is divided into six Python files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[nirams_ii_main.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/nirams_ii_main.py)** is the main entry point for those wishing to perform a single run of the model (i.e. produce output based on a single parameter set). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[nirams_ii_param_combos.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/nirams_ii_param_combos.py)** allows users to specify lists of possible values for the model's physical parameters. The model is then run once for each unique parameter combination in the supplied lists. This makes it easier to explore different model parameterisations without undertaking full sensitivity or uncertaninty analyses (e.g. using MCMC). The code uses Python's `multiprocessing` module to distribute model runs across multiple processes, improving overall performance. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[input_output.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/input_output.py)**. All the input datasets required to run NIRAMS II are stored in an [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) data store. Model outputs are also written to this format and (optionally) as a series of GeoTiffs. The functions in `input_output.py` streamline the process of reading and writing these various data formats. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[snow.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/snow.py)** provides functions for calculating volumes of snowfall and snow melt based on a simple degree-day melting model, as described above. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[drainage.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/drainage.py)** <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[nitrate.py](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/Code/nitrate.py)**.\n",
