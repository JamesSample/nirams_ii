    "## 1. Model background and development\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Original NIRAMS model\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Nitrogen Risk Assessment Model for Scotland (NIRAMS) was developed at the Macaulay Institute (now the James Hutton Institute) during 2002/3. Development work was led by Dr. Sarah Dunn and a description of the model is provided by Dunn *et al.* ([2004a](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/8/191/2004/hess-8-191-2004.html) and [2004b](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/8/205/2004/hess-8-205-2004.html)). One of the main motivations was to create a simple, Scotland-specific nitrate leaching model, similar to the MAGPIE model for England and Wales developed by [Lord and Anthony (2006)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2000.tb00222.x/abstract). The model was designed with the EU Nitrates Directive (ND) in mind and key requirements included being able to apply it at national scale and in areas with sparse observational data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Physical process representations were kept very simple in order to reduce the number of parameters as far as possible. NIRAMS is therefore highly conceptualised, with most of its computational complexity coming from the fact it is fully spatially distributed (i.e. grid based) rather than because any of the individual calculations are complex. This makes the model unusual, because historically most developers of water quality models have refined and increased the process complexity first, before expanding the spatial domain. For example, most fully distributed water quality models (e.g. [MIKE SHE](https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/products/mike-she)) are extremely complex and highly parameterised, and even semi-distributed models like [INCA](http://www.reading.ac.uk/geographyandenvironmentalscience/research/INCA/) and [HYPE](http://hype.sourceforge.net/) have much more complicated process representation than NIRAMS. \n",
    "\n",
    "NIRAMS could therefore be criticised for being both slow (because it’s spatially distributed) and overly simplistic. On the other hand, the grid-based outputs are extremely flexible, because results from a single model run can be analysed in different ways for different spatial units. Furthermore, outside of a handful of academic study catchments, we generally lack the observational data necessary to robustly calibrate and evaluate highly parameterised models, so the simplicity of NIRAMS may be an advantage for many practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. NIRAMS II\n",
    "\n",
    "The original model was coded in [Avenue](ftp://www.kcgov.us/KCCSData/KCGIS/Into2AV/Intro2Avenue/avenue.htm) for ArcView 3.x. Although Avenue is still a useful language for grid computations, it was officially discontinued in 2002 and subsequent releases of ArcGIS have favoured first Visual Basic and, most recently, [Python](https://www.python.org/). Starting in 2011, the NIRAMS Avenue code was ported to Python 2.7 and, at the same time, the model’s handling of agricultural data was redesigned by switching from parish-level census summaries to more detailed field- and farm-scale information based on the [Scottish Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/farmingrural/Agriculture/grants/Schemes/18148/11836). This adds significantly to the complexity of pre-processing the model's input data, but has the advantage of providing more spatial detail and allowing e.g. identification of potential diffuse pollution “hotspots”. A number of other changes were also made, including refining the nitrate leaching representation by incorporating processes from the STREAM-N model ([Dunn *et al.*, 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941300735X)) and enhancing the model's performance and temporal resolution. Nevertheless, the basic structure and conceptualisation of NIRAMS II remains largely unchanged compared to the original.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Installation and usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the NIRAMS II model directly, the user must first obtain the **input HDF5 file** containing gridded datasets representing meterological time series, soil properites and agricultural activities. This file cannot be made freely available, as several of the datasets included in it were obtained under a license that precludes redistribution. If you are interested in using the model for academic research of relevance to the Scottish Government, it may be possible to make this file available - please contact the [James Hutton Institute](http://www.hutton.ac.uk/contact-us) in Aberdeen. **Without the input file the code will not run directly**, although it may be possible to generate your own input file or to adapt the code to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having negotitated access to the input file, the next step is to **install Python 2.7**. If you're on Windows, I highly recommend [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/), which is a portable Python distribution that will not interfere with anything else on your system. You will also need to install **[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)**, either by entering `pip install gdal` at the *WinPython* command prompt (not the standard Windows command prompt), or by downloading the appropriate [Python \"wheel\"](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal) and using the WinPython control panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Installing NIRAMS II\n",
    "\n",
    "NIRAMS II can be installed by visiting the [repository home page](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii) and clicking the \"**Download ZIP**\" button towards the right-hand edge of the screen. Extract the .zip archive to any location on your system, then open the *WinPython* command prompt (not the standard Windows command prompt) and change directory to the \"**Code**\" folder (the folder containing `setup.py`) by typing e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd D:\\nirams_ii\\Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Then type\n",
    "\n",
    "    python setup.py install\n",
    "    \n",
    "to install the NIRAMS II package. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should also make a working copy of the Excel file `nirams_ii_input_template.xlsx`, which is located in the top level of the extracted directory. This file is used to set user-specified options and parameters to configure each model run. **Note:** it is important that you only edit the \"**Value**\" columns in this spreadsheet; modifying any other cells may lead to errors when the model is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installer has completed and copied the Excel file, you can delete the .zip archive and the extracted folder from your system. If you need to download a fresh copy of the input template at any point, it can always be accessed [here](https://github.com/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/nirams_ii_input_template.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3. Running the model\n",
    "\n",
    "NIRAMS II can be run in two modes: `single_run` and `param_combos`. These names also refer to the two worksheets in `nirams_ii_input_template.xlsx`, which allows the user to set options for each run type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to run NIRAMS II is in `single_run` mode. Here the user must open the `single_run` sheet of the Excel template and fill-in appropriate entries in the `Value` column of each row. The rows specify, for example, the location of the input HDF% data file, the time period of interest, the output file to be created etc. There are also options to define the physical parameters for this model run. As described above, NIRAMS II has 7 physical parameters, which can be adjusted to control the model's behavior. In `single_run` mode, the user must specify a **single value** for each of these physical parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second mode, `param_combos`, allows the user to explore multiple different parameter sets. The code provided does *not* allow full auto-calibration or uncertainty estimation (see [section 6]() for further discussion of this), but it does make it easier to explore a range of different model parameterisations. To run the model in this mode, the user must fill-in the `param_combos` sheet of the Excel template. Most of the information required is the same as for a single run, but in this mode the user can enter **lists of values** for each of the 7 **physical parameters**. The code then calculates all unique combinations of the specified parameters and runs the model once for each parameter set. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the user entered single values for the first 5 physical parameters, but `0.01, 0.02` for the `Denitrification parameter` and `1.0, 1.1` for the `N leaching parameter`, the model would be run **four times** in total, with the first 5 parameters kept constant and the last two varied as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Run ID | Denitrification parameter | N leaching parameter |\n",
    "|:------:|--------------------------:|---------------------:|\n",
    "|    1   |                      0.01 |                  1.0 |\n",
    "|    2   |                      0.01 |                  1.1 |\n",
    "|    3   |                      0.02 |                  1.0 |\n",
    "|    4   |                      0.02 |                  1.1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in `param_combos` mode the user can specify the number of processors available for distributing the model runs. where this number is greater than 1, simple parallelisation is achieved using Python's [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having completed the appropriate worksheet of the Excel template, running the model is as simple as creating Python script such as\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # This line is important - see explanation below\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':        \n",
    "        from niramsii import nirams\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Specify path to the completed Excel template\n",
    "        in_xls = r'D:\\nirams_ii_input_template.xlsx'\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Run the model in 'single_run' mode\n",
    "        nirams.run_model(in_xls, 'single_run')\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the last two lines of the above script could be replaced by\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Run the model in 'param_combos' mode\n",
    "        nirams.run_model(in_xls, 'param_combos')\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** When running NIRAMS II in `param_combos` mode, it is **important** to place all your code within an\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    \n",
    "block. This is due to the way the multiprocessing module works on Windows - see e.g. [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14175348/why-does-pythons-multiprocessing-module-import-main-when-starting-a-new-pro) for a more detailed explanation. Placing `if __name__ == '__main__'` at the top of your script should not affect the behaviour of your code, but without it the multiprocessing component of NIRAMS II will generate recurring errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model output\n",
    "\n",
    "The model generates 1 km, annual resolution grids for the specified bounding box representing, for each grid cell, the **amount of nitrate-N leached (kg/ha)**, the **total drainage (mm)** and the **sub-surface drainage (mm)**. The sub-surface drainage is the sum of the water following the shallow sub-surface and groundwater flow pathways; the total drainage includes overland flow as well (see diagram in [section 2]()). These grids can be ued to estimate nitrate loadings and concentrations from the surface to any region (e.g. a groundwater body) within the specified bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output grids are written to an HDF5 file and, optionally, to a series of GeoTiffs. The HDF5 output is more compact and portable, but the GeoTiffs are easier to work within in e.g. ArcGIS and are therefore useful for exploring the output quickly and for making maps. Note that to view the output GeoTiffs in ArcGIS you will first need to **calculate statistics** (right-click in ArcCatalog), otherwise they will display as blank \"NoData\" grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "A GUI for the HDF5 files is provided by [ViTables](http://vitables.org/), which is included with the standard WinPython installation. To access the ViTables, open the WinPython command prompt and type\n",
    "\n",
    "    vitables\n",
    "    \n",
    "The output HDF5 files are designed to be **self-describing**, in the sense that all the parameter values and user options for each run are stored within the file itself. The screenshot below shows the output HDF5 from running NIRAMS II in `param_combos` mode, with the key properties for each run listed under the \"**User attributes**\" tab.\n",

    "To illustrate the kind of output generated by the model, the maps below show some of the results used to inform the 2013 Nitrates Directive review in Scotland. The left-hand image shows the estimated runoff grid, while the right-hand one shows nitrate-N concentrations averaged over Scotland's bedrock groundwater bodies.\n",
