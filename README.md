# The Nitrogen Risk Assessment Model for Scotland (version 2; NIRAMS II)

NIRAMS II is a simple, spatially distributed nitrate leaching model designed to estimate nitrate loadings to groundwater bodies from the base of the soil profile. The model was developed by the [James Hutton Institute](http://www.hutton.ac.uk/) and has been used to support the Scottish Government's four-yearly review of the [EU Nitrates Directive](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-nitrates/index_en.html).

A decription of the code available is provided [here](), together with background information on the NIRAMS model and its development. A report describing how NIRAMS II was used to support the 2013 review of the Nitrates Directive in Scotland [is also available](http://www.crew.ac.uk/sites/www.crew.ac.uk/files/calldownservice/CREW_nvz%20report.pdf).
