# The Nitrogen Risk Assessment Model for Scotland (version 2; NIRAMS II)

NIRAMS II is a simple, spatially distributed nitrate leaching model designed to estimate nitrate loadings to groundwater from the base of the soil profile. The model was developed by the [James Hutton Institute](http://www.hutton.ac.uk/) and has been used to support the Scottish Government's four-yearly review of the [EU Nitrates Directive](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-nitrates/index_en.html).

## Requirements

  * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
  * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
  * [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [H5py](http://www.h5py.org/)
  * [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)

If you're installing from scratch on Windows then I thoroughly recommend the [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/) installation.

## Documentation

Background to the model's development, its uses and some basic documentation are provided [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/nirams_ii_notes.ipynb).

## Previous applications

A report detailing how NIRAMS II was used to support the 2013 review of the Nitrates Directive in Scotland is available [here](http://www.crew.ac.uk/sites/www.crew.ac.uk/files/calldownservice/CREW_nvz%20report.pdf).
